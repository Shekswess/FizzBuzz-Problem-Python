# FizzBuzz-Interview-Problem

-This project is made for seeing different solutions to a simple problem.

-The goal of this project is to make something simple but effective project.

-the problem goes like this: Looping through numbers from 1 to 100, if the number is divisible by 3 then print Fizz if the number is divisible by 5 then print Buzz, if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print FizzBuzz and if the number is not divisible by 3 and 5 print the number.

-Maybe this Project can be upgraded or better optimised but I'm satisfied.

-To run the project you need to have python3 installed. You download the code and you open the folder where the code is using the command line.

-I hope you like this project and find it helpful !
